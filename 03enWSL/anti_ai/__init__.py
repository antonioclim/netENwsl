"""Anti-AI tooling for Week 3.

This package provides a small, privacy-aware and reproducible workflow for:
- generating a per-student challenge file (tokens and recommended parameters)
- collecting verifiable evidence (hashes and lightweight environment fingerprint)
- validating a submission using cryptographically verifiable constraints

The design goal is not to prohibit AI tools. The goal is to ensure that an AI tool
alone is insufficient to produce a valid submission without real execution.

All wording is in British English and aims to remain suitable for academic use.
