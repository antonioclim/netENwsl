## ⚠️ Academic Integrity Notice

These solutions are provided **for reference only** after the submission deadline has passed.

**Prohibited Actions:**
- Copying solutions directly without understanding
- Sharing with students who have not yet submitted
- Presenting these solutions as your own work

**Encouraged Actions:**
- Compare your implementation approach with the reference
- Learn from different implementation strategies
- Discuss unclear sections with the instructor

## Solution Files

| File | Topic | Key Concepts |
|------|-------|--------------|
| `hw_10_01_https_analysis_solution.py` | HTTPS Analysis | TLS handshake, certificate verification |
| `hw_10_02_rest_client_solution.py` | REST Client | HTTP methods, JSON parsing, error handling |
| `hw_10_03_dns_resolver_solution.py` | DNS Resolution | Query types, recursive vs iterative |

## Self-Assessment Checklist

After reviewing these solutions, verify your understanding:

- [ ] Can I explain the TLS handshake process step by step?
- [ ] Do I understand the difference between HTTP and HTTPS at the packet level?
- [ ] Can I implement a REST client without referring to the solution?
- [ ] Do I know how DNS resolution works recursively?

## Learning from Solutions

### Recommended Approach

1. **First:** Complete your own implementation entirely
2. **Then:** Run both versions and compare outputs
3. **Finally:** Identify differences in approach and discuss

### Common Differences to Note

- Error handling strategies
- Code organisation and modularity
- Documentation completeness
- Edge case coverage
