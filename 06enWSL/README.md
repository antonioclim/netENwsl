# Week 6: NAT/PAT, Network Support Protocols & Software-Defined Networking

> NETWORKING class - ASE, Informatics | Computer Networks Laboratory
> 
> by ing. dr. Antonio Clim

## Overview

This laboratory session integrates two complementary domains of modern network architecture: address translation mechanisms that sustain IPv4's extended lifecycle and the architectural change towards software-defined networking (SDN) that decouples control logic from forwarding hardware.

The first component examines Network Address Translation (NAT) and its port-multiplexed variant (PAT/NAPT), protocols that have become essential infrastructure for private-to-public address mapping. Students will configure iptables-based MASQUERADE rules on a Linux router, observe the bidirectional translation process and analyse how ephemeral port allocation enables multiple internal hosts to share a single public address.

The second component introduces SDN architecture through OpenFlow 1.3, demonstrating the fundamental separation between control plane (centralised decision-making) and data plane (distributed packet forwarding). Using OS-Ken as the controller framework and Open vSwitch as the programmable switch, students will implement and observe flow-based policies that selectively permit or block traffic based on source, destination and protocol criteria.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this laboratory session, you will be able to:

1. **Recall** the purpose and classification of NAT variants (static, dynamic, PAT) and the role of auxiliary protocols (ARP, DHCP, ICMP, NDP)
2. **Explain** how PAT translation tables maintain bidirectional session state and why this mechanism creates challenges for inbound connections
3. **Implement** NAT/MASQUERADE rules using iptables on a multi-homed Linux router within a simulated topology
4. **Demonstrate** SDN flow installation by observing controller-switch communication and inspecting flow tables with ovs-ofctl
5. **Analyse** the behavioural differences between permitted and blocked traffic in an SDN topology, correlating packet outcomes with installed flow rules
6. **Compare** traditional distributed routing with centralised SDN control, articulating trade-offs in scalability, flexibility and failure domains
7. **Design** custom OpenFlow policies that implement per-host, per-protocol access control within a software-defined network

## Prerequisites

### Knowledge Requirements

- Understanding of IPv4 addressing, subnetting and CIDR notation (Weeks 4-5)
- Familiarity with TCP/UDP socket programming concepts (Weeks 2-3)
- Basic Linux command-line proficiency (file navigation, process management)
- Conceptual understanding of the OSI and TCP/IP models

### Software Requirements

- Windows 10/11 with WSL2 enabled (Ubuntu 22.04 or later)
- Docker Desktop with WSL2 backend integration

### Hardware Requirements

- Minimum 8GB RAM (16GB recommended for parallel container execution)
- 10GB free disk space
- Network connectivity (for initial package installation)

## ⚠️ Common Misconceptions

Before starting, review these frequent misunderstandings in `docs/misconceptions.md`:

- "NAT provides security" — it provides obscurity, not security
- "SDN controller forwards packets" — it only installs rules; switches forward
- "Higher priority number means lower importance" — opposite is true in OpenFlow

For technical terms, consult `docs/glossary.md`.

## Academic integrity and anti-AI workflow

You may use an LLM as a learning aid (for explanations, debugging and alternative perspectives). For graded submissions however you must provide execution artefacts that are difficult to fabricate from text alone.

Week 6 includes a lightweight challenge–evidence–validator workflow in `anti_ai/`:

1. Generate a per-student challenge

   ```bash
   make anti-ai-challenge STUDENT_ID=YOUR_ID
   ```

2. Produce a short report in plain text or Markdown that includes the **report token** printed by the challenge generator

3. Generate real traffic in the NAT or SDN topology that includes the **payload token** then capture that traffic in a `.pcap` file

   The easiest approach is to send the payload token as the `--message` argument of `src/apps/tcp_echo.py` or `src/apps/udp_echo.py` and capture with `tcpdump`

4. Collect evidence and hash the artefacts

   ```bash
   make anti-ai-evidence STUDENT_ID=YOUR_ID \
     ANTI_AI_ARTEFACTS="path/to/report.md path/to/capture.pcap"
   ```

   If you want the collector to attempt live probes via `docker exec` set `RUN_PROBES=1`

5. Validate locally before submission

   ```bash
   make anti-ai-validate STUDENT_ID=YOUR_ID
   ```

This workflow does not prevent misuse completely but it raises the cost of submitting purely synthetic answers and encourages students to engage with the laboratory environment.

## Laboratory Exercises

> 👥 **Pair Programming:** See `docs/pair_programming_guide.md` for Driver/Navigator roles.
> 
> 🗳️ **Peer Instruction:** Answer questions in `docs/peer_instruction.md` before exercises.

### Exercise 1: NAT/PAT Configuration and Observation

**Objective:** Configure MASQUERADE NAT on a Linux router and observe port address translation in action.

**Duration:** 40 minutes

**Background:** When private hosts (RFC 1918 addresses) communicate with public servers, NAT rewrites source addresses to the router's public IP. PAT extends this by also translating source ports, enabling multiple internal hosts to share a single public address.

**Steps:**

1. Start the NAT topology:
   ```powershell
   python scripts/run_demo.py --demo nat
   ```

2. 💭 **PREDICTION:** Before checking, what IP addresses do you expect to see on rnat's interfaces?

3. In the Mininet CLI, verify interface configuration:
   ```bash
   rnat ifconfig
   rnat iptables -t nat -L -n -v
   ```

4. Start the NAT observer on the public server (h3):
   ```bash
   h3 python3 src/apps/nat_observer.py server --bind 203.0.113.2 --port 5000
   ```

5. 💭 **PREDICTION:** When h1 connects to h3, what source IP will h3 see? What about the source port?

6. From private hosts, initiate connections:
   ```bash
   h1 python3 src/apps/nat_observer.py client --host 203.0.113.2 --port 5000 --msg "Hello from h1"
   h2 python3 src/apps/nat_observer.py client --host 203.0.113.2 --port 5000 --msg "Hello from h2"
   ```

7. Observe the server output — note that both connections appear to originate from 203.0.113.1 (the NAT public IP) with different source ports.

8. 💭 **PREDICTION:** How many entries will you see in the conntrack table?

9. Verify NAT translations:
   ```bash
   rnat conntrack -L 2>/dev/null || rnat cat /proc/net/nf_conntrack
   ```

**Expected Observations:**
- Private addresses (192.168.1.x) are never visible on the public side
- Each connection from different internal hosts uses a unique translated port
- The NAT table maintains bidirectional state for return traffic

**Verification:**
```powershell
python tests/test_exercises.py --exercise 1
```

### Exercise 2: SDN Topology and Flow Observation

**Objective:** Deploy an SDN topology with an OpenFlow controller and observe flow-based packet forwarding.

**Duration:** 35 minutes

**Background:** SDN separates the control plane (where forwarding decisions are made) from the data plane (where packets are actually forwarded). The controller installs flow rules in switches that define match-action pairs.

**Steps:**

1. Start the SDN topology with flow rules:
   ```powershell
   python scripts/run_demo.py --demo sdn
   ```

2. 💭 **PREDICTION:** How many flow entries do you expect in the initial flow table?

3. Examine the initial flow table:
   ```bash
   sh ovs-ofctl -O OpenFlow13 dump-flows s1
   ```

4. 💭 **PREDICTION:** Will h1 be able to ping h2? Will h1 be able to ping h3?

5. Test permitted connectivity (h1 ↔ h2):
   ```bash
   h1 ping -c 3 10.0.6.12
   h2 ping -c 3 10.0.6.11
   ```

6. Test blocked connectivity (h1 → h3):
   ```bash
   h1 ping -c 3 10.0.6.13
   ```

7. 💭 **PREDICTION:** After the ping tests, how many new flow entries will exist?

8. Observe the flow table again — note new entries for matched traffic:
   ```bash
   sh ovs-ofctl -O OpenFlow13 dump-flows s1
   ```

9. Analyse flow statistics:
   ```bash
   sh ovs-ofctl -O OpenFlow13 dump-flows s1 --rsort=n_packets
   ```

**Expected Observations:**
- h1 ↔ h2 traffic succeeds (flow rules permit)
- h1 → h3 ICMP traffic is dropped (specific drop rule)
- Flow entries show packet and byte counters increasing

**Verification:**
```powershell
python tests/test_exercises.py --exercise 2
```

### Exercise 3: SDN Policy Modification

**Objective:** Understand how SDN policies affect traffic by modifying flow rules dynamically.

**Duration:** 25 minutes

**Steps:**

1. With the SDN topology running, add a rule to permit ICMP from h1 to h3:

   💭 **PREDICTION:** If you add a rule with priority=300, will it override the existing drop rule (priority=30)?

   ```bash
   sh ovs-ofctl -O OpenFlow13 add-flow s1 "priority=300,icmp,nw_src=10.0.6.11,nw_dst=10.0.6.13,actions=output:3"
   ```

2. Test connectivity again:
   ```bash
   h1 ping -c 3 10.0.6.13
   ```

3. Remove the rule and verify blocking resumes:
   ```bash
   sh ovs-ofctl -O OpenFlow13 del-flows s1 "priority=300,icmp,nw_src=10.0.6.11,nw_dst=10.0.6.13"
   h1 ping -c 3 10.0.6.13
   ```

4. Experiment with protocol-specific rules (TCP vs UDP):
   ```bash
   # Start TCP server on h3
   h3 python3 src/apps/tcp_echo.py server --bind 10.0.6.13 --port 9090 &
   
   # Try TCP connection from h1 (should be blocked by default)
   h1 python3 src/apps/tcp_echo.py client --dst 10.0.6.13 --port 9090 --message "Test"
   
   # Add TCP permit rule
   sh ovs-ofctl -O OpenFlow13 add-flow s1 "priority=300,tcp,nw_dst=10.0.6.13,actions=output:3"
   
   # Retry TCP connection
   h1 python3 src/apps/tcp_echo.py client --dst 10.0.6.13 --port 9090 --message "Test"
   ```

**Verification:**
```powershell
python tests/test_exercises.py --exercise 3
```

## Demonstrations

### Demo 1: NAT Translation Visualisation

Automated demonstration showing PAT in action with multiple simultaneous connections.

```powershell
python scripts/run_demo.py --demo nat-visual
```

**What to observe:**
- Real-time NAT table updates as connections are established
- Port allocation patterns for concurrent connections
- Connection state transitions (ESTABLISHED, TIME_WAIT)

### Demo 2: SDN Flow Installation

Demonstrates the controller-switch interaction during flow installation.

```powershell
python scripts/run_demo.py --demo sdn-flows
```

**What to observe:**
- Packet-in events sent to controller for unknown traffic
- Flow-mod messages installing new rules
- Subsequent packets matching installed flows (no controller involvement)

## Packet Capture and Analysis

### Capturing Traffic

```powershell
# Start capture for NAT topology
python scripts/capture_traffic.py --topology nat --output pcap/nat_capture.pcap

# Start capture for SDN topology
python scripts/capture_traffic.py --topology sdn --output pcap/sdn_capture.pcap
```

### Recommended Wireshark Filters

```
# NAT/PAT analysis
ip.addr == 203.0.113.1 && icmp
tcp.port == 5000

# SDN/OpenFlow analysis
openflow_v4
of13.type == 10  # Packet-in
of13.type == 14  # Flow-mod

# ARP traffic
arp

# ICMP traffic
icmp || icmpv6
```

### Opening Captures in Wireshark

The captured files are stored in the `pcap/` directory and can be opened directly in Wireshark on Windows.

## Shutdown and Cleanup

### End of Session

```powershell
# Stop all containers gracefully (preserves data)
python scripts/stop_lab.py

# Verify shutdown
docker ps
```

### Full Cleanup (Before Next Week)

```powershell
# Remove all containers, networks and volumes for this week
python scripts/cleanup.py --full

# Verify cleanup
docker system df

# Optional: prune unused Docker resources
python scripts/cleanup.py --full --prune
```

## Homework Assignments

See the `homework/` directory for take-home exercises.

### Assignment 1: Extended NAT Analysis

Document the NAT translation process for the following scenario:
- Three internal hosts simultaneously connecting to the same external server
- Each host makes two connections (HTTP and HTTPS)
- Capture and analyse the NAT table state

**Deliverable:** `homework/exercises/hw_6_01_nat_analysis.md`

### Assignment 2: Custom SDN Policy Implementation

Design and implement an SDN policy that:
- Permits HTTP (port 80) and HTTPS (port 443) from all hosts to h3
- Blocks all ICMP to h3 except from h2
- Permits SSH (port 22) only from h1 to h2

**Deliverable:** `homework/exercises/hw_6_02_sdn_policy.py`

## Troubleshooting

### Before You Debug: Predictions

Before examining troubleshooting, ask yourself:
1. What did I expect to happen?
2. What actually happened?
3. What's the difference?

See `docs/troubleshooting.md` for common issues and `docs/misconceptions.md` for frequent misunderstandings.

### Common Issues

#### Issue: Mininet cleanup errors ("File exists")
**Solution:** Run cleanup with force flag:
```powershell
python scripts/cleanup.py --force
# Or manually in WSL:
sudo mn -c
```

#### Issue: OVS switch not connecting to controller
**Solution:** Verify controller is running and port is accessible:
```bash
ss -ltn | grep 6633
ovs-vsctl show
```

#### Issue: Docker containers fail to start in privileged mode
**Solution:** Ensure Docker Desktop is configured for WSL2 integration:
1. Open Docker Desktop Settings
2. Go to Resources > WSL Integration
3. Enable integration with your Ubuntu distribution

#### Issue: NAT not translating packets
**Solution:** Verify IP forwarding is enabled:
```bash
sysctl net.ipv4.ip_forward
# Should be 1; if not:
sudo sysctl -w net.ipv4.ip_forward=1
```

#### Issue: SDN topology pings are slow or timeout
**Solution:** Check if flow rules are installed:
```bash
ovs-ofctl -O OpenFlow13 dump-flows s1
```
If empty or only table-miss rule exists, the controller may not be functioning correctly.

See `docs/troubleshooting.md` for additional solutions.

## Theoretical Background

### NAT and PAT

Network Address Translation emerged as a response to IPv4 address exhaustion, enabling organisations to use private address ranges (RFC 1918: 10.0.0.0/8, 172.16.0.0/12, 192.168.0.0/16) internally while sharing limited public addresses externally. Port Address Translation extends this by multiplexing connections through port numbers, allowing thousands of internal hosts to share a single public IP.

The translation process involves:
1. **Outbound:** Rewriting source IP (and port in PAT) to the NAT device's public address
2. **State tracking:** Maintaining a translation table mapping internal to external tuples
3. **Inbound:** Reverse translation using the stored state

### Software-Defined Networking

SDN represents a fundamental architectural shift from distributed to centralised network control. Key principles include:
1. **Separation of concerns:** Control logic (controller) distinct from forwarding (switches)
2. **Programmability:** Network behaviour defined through software APIs
3. **Centralised view:** Controller maintains global network state
4. **Flow-based forwarding:** Packets matched against rules and actions applied

OpenFlow provides the southbound interface between controller and switches, defining how flow tables are populated and queried.

## Self-Assessment Checklist

Before leaving the lab, verify you can answer these questions:

### NAT/PAT Understanding

- [ ] Can you explain why NAT provides obscurity but not security?
- [ ] Do you understand how PAT uses port numbers to multiplex connections?
- [ ] Can you trace a packet through NAT translation in both directions?
- [ ] Do you know what happens to conntrack entries after timeout?

### SDN Understanding

- [ ] Can you explain the difference between control plane and data plane?
- [ ] Do you understand why higher priority number means higher importance in OpenFlow?
- [ ] Can you predict which flow rule will match a given packet?
- [ ] Do you know when the SDN controller is contacted vs when it isn't?

### Practical Skills

- [ ] Can you start and stop the lab environment?
- [ ] Can you examine NAT tables using conntrack or /proc/net/nf_conntrack?
- [ ] Can you view and modify SDN flow rules using ovs-ofctl?
- [ ] Can you use Wireshark to capture and analyse NAT/SDN traffic?

### Misconception Check

Review `docs/misconceptions.md` and confirm you no longer hold these beliefs:
- [ ] "NAT provides security" — No, only obscurity
- [ ] "Source port is always preserved" — No, NAT may change it
- [ ] "Controller forwards every packet" — No, only installs rules
- [ ] "Priority 1 is highest" — No, higher number = higher priority

If you cannot check all boxes, review the relevant documentation before next week.
