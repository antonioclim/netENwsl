"""
Anti-AI utilities for Week 4.

The goal is not to ban AI tools. The goal is to make AI insufficient on its own by
requiring execution-backed evidence such as network captures with per-submission tokens.

These modules are designed to run in WSL2 and in CI without requiring Docker to be present.
