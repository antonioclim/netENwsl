## 📚 Project Description

Implement a simplified FTP server that supports multiple concurrent clients. The server will handle standard FTP commands for file listing, upload, download, and directory navigation. This project provides deep understanding of the FTP protocol with its unique dual-channel architecture (control + data).

### 🎯 Learning Objectives

- **LO1:** Implement FTP command/response protocol over control connection
- **LO2:** Manage separate data connections for file transfers
- **LO3:** Support both active and passive transfer modes
- **LO4:** Handle multiple clients concurrently using threading
- **LO5:** Implement user authentication
- **LO6:** Parse and generate FTP protocol messages

### 🛠️ Technologies and Tools

| Technology | Purpose | Documentation |
|------------|---------|---------------|
| **Python sockets** | Network programming | [docs.python.org](https://docs.python.org/3/library/socket.html) |
| **threading** | Concurrent clients | [docs.python.org](https://docs.python.org/3/library/threading.html) |
| **FTP RFC 959** | Protocol specification | [RFC 959](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc959) |
| **FileZilla** | FTP client testing | [filezilla-project.org](https://filezilla-project.org) |

### 📖 Key Concepts

| Concept | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Control Connection** | Port 21, sends commands/responses |
| **Data Connection** | Transfers files and directory listings |
| **Active Mode** | Server connects to client's data port |
| **Passive Mode** | Client connects to server's data port |
| **Response Codes** | 3-digit codes (220, 331, 230, 550) |
| **ASCII/Binary Mode** | Text vs binary transfer |
| **PWD/CWD** | Print/Change working directory |
| **RETR/STOR** | Retrieve (download) / Store (upload) |

## 🎯 Concept Analogies

### FTP = Phone Call with Fax

🏠 **Real-World Analogy:**  
You call someone (control connection) to discuss what documents to send. When ready to transfer, you use a fax machine (data connection) to send the actual documents. The phone call stays open to coordinate, but the fax is a separate channel for the data.

💻 **Technical Mapping:**
- Phone call = Control connection (port 21)
- Fax machine = Data connection (port 20 or random)
- "Please send invoice" = RETR invoice.pdf
- "Document received" = 226 Transfer complete

⚠️ **Where the analogy breaks:** Modern fax doesn't require a separate phone call. FTP's dual-channel design is a historical artifact from when this made sense for network architecture.

---

### Active vs Passive = Who Calls Whom

🏠 **Real-World Analogy:**  
Active mode: "I'll call you back at this number" — server calls client. Passive mode: "Here's my direct line, call me" — client calls server.

💻 **Technical Mapping:**
- Active: Client sends PORT command with its IP:port, server connects
- Passive: Client sends PASV, server replies with IP:port, client connects

## 🗳️ Peer Instruction Questions

### Question 1: Why Two Connections?

> 💭 **PREDICTION:** Why does FTP use separate control and data connections?

**Options:**
- A) Security reasons
- B) Allow commands while transferring ✓
- C) Faster transfers
- D) Protocol limitation

**Correct answer:** B

**Explanation:** With separate channels, you can send commands (like ABOR to cancel) while a file transfer is in progress. The control connection remains responsive.

---

### Question 2: Passive Mode Purpose

> 💭 **PREDICTION:** When is passive mode necessary?

**Options:**
- A) When server is behind firewall
- B) When client is behind NAT/firewall ✓
- C) For faster transfers
- D) For secure transfers

**Correct answer:** B

**Explanation:** In active mode, the server connects TO the client — but if the client is behind NAT, the server can't reach it. Passive mode reverses this: client connects to server, which works through NAT.

---

### Question 3: Response Code Meaning

> 💭 **PREDICTION:** What does response code 550 mean?

**Options:**
- A) Success
- B) Need password
- C) File not found/permission denied ✓
- D) Transfer complete

**Correct answer:** C

**Explanation:** 5xx codes indicate permanent failures. 550 specifically means "Requested action not taken" — usually file not found or permission denied.

---

### Question 4: PORT Command

> 💭 **PREDICTION:** What does PORT 192,168,1,5,4,1 mean?

**Options:**
- A) Server port 4.1
- B) IP 192.168.1.5, port 1025 ✓
- C) IP 192.168.1.54, port 1
- D) Error format

**Correct answer:** B

**Explanation:** PORT format is h1,h2,h3,h4,p1,p2. Port = p1*256 + p2 = 4*256 + 1 = 1025. IP = 192.168.1.5.

## ❌ Common Misconceptions

### 🚫 "FTP is secure"

**WRONG:** Standard FTP sends passwords in plain text.

**CORRECT:** FTP has no encryption. Use FTPS (FTP over TLS) or SFTP (SSH File Transfer) for security. Your project can note this limitation.

---

### 🚫 "Port 21 transfers files"

**WRONG:** All FTP traffic goes through port 21.

**CORRECT:** Port 21 is only for commands. Files transfer on separate connections (port 20 for active, random high port for passive).

---

### 🚫 "Active mode is better"

**WRONG:** Active mode is the original, so it's better.

**CORRECT:** Passive mode works better with modern networks (NAT, firewalls). Most clients default to passive.

## 📖 Glossary

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| **Control Connection** | TCP connection on port 21 for commands |
| **Data Connection** | Separate TCP connection for file data |
| **Active Mode** | Server initiates data connection to client |
| **Passive Mode** | Client initiates data connection to server |
| **ASCII Mode** | Text transfer with line ending conversion |
| **Binary Mode** | Raw byte transfer without conversion |
| **RETR** | Retrieve (download) a file |
| **STOR** | Store (upload) a file |
| **PASV** | Request passive mode |
| **Response Code** | 3-digit status (2xx success, 5xx error) |

## ❓ Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: How do I test with FileZilla?**

A: Connect to localhost:21 with your test credentials. Enable passive mode in settings if behind NAT.

**Q: Why does active mode fail?**

A: Your client is probably behind NAT. Server can't connect back. Use passive mode.
