## 📚 Project Description

Build a network Intrusion Detection and Prevention System (IDS/IPS) that monitors traffic, detects common attacks, and optionally blocks malicious activity. Implement both signature-based detection (matching known patterns) and threshold-based detection (identifying anomalies like too many connections).

### 🎯 Learning Objectives

- **LO1:** Implement signature-based attack detection
- **LO2:** Design threshold-based anomaly detection
- **LO3:** Generate security alerts with proper severity levels
- **LO4:** Implement automatic blocking (IPS mode)
- **LO5:** Evaluate detection accuracy (true/false positives)
- **LO6:** Manage and update detection signatures

### 🛠️ Technologies and Tools

| Technology | Purpose | Documentation |
|------------|---------|---------------|
| **Scapy** | Packet capture and analysis | [scapy.readthedocs.io](https://scapy.readthedocs.io) |
| **iptables** | Packet blocking (IPS) | Linux man pages |
| **nmap** | Attack simulation | [nmap.org](https://nmap.org) |
| **hping3** | Packet crafting | [hping.org](http://www.hping.org) |

### 📖 Key Concepts

| Concept | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **IDS** | Intrusion Detection System — detects and alerts |
| **IPS** | Intrusion Prevention System — detects and blocks |
| **Signature** | Known pattern of malicious traffic |
| **Threshold** | Limit triggering anomaly detection |
| **Port Scan** | Probing multiple ports to find services |
| **SYN Flood** | DoS attack using incomplete TCP handshakes |
| **Brute Force** | Repeated login attempts |
| **False Positive** | Alert on legitimate traffic |
| **False Negative** | Missed actual attack |

## ⛔ Constraints (MUST/MUST NOT)

- [ ] MUST log all alerts with timestamp, severity, details
- [ ] MUST support configurable detection thresholds
- [ ] MUST implement both IDS (alert) and IPS (block) modes
- [ ] MUST handle high traffic volumes without crashing
- [ ] MUST pass all smoke tests

### MUST NOT (Forbidden)
- [ ] MUST NOT scan or attack systems without permission
- [ ] MUST NOT hardcode detection signatures
- [ ] MUST NOT block without logging
- [ ] MUST NOT ignore malformed packets

### SHOULD (Recommended)
- [ ] SHOULD calculate false positive rate
- [ ] SHOULD support signature hot-reload
- [ ] SHOULD provide statistics dashboard

---

## 🎯 Concept Analogies

### IDS vs IPS = Security Camera vs Guard

🏠 **Real-World Analogy:**  
IDS is like a security camera — it records everything and alerts security, but doesn't stop intruders. IPS is like a security guard — detects threats AND takes action (blocks entry).

💻 **Technical Mapping:**
- Camera = IDS (passive monitoring)
- Guard = IPS (active blocking)
- Recording = Packet capture/logging
- Alert to security = Alert notification
- Physical intervention = iptables DROP rule

---

### Signature Detection = Wanted Poster Matching

🏠 **Real-World Analogy:**  
Police use wanted posters with specific features (height, scar, tattoo). They match suspects against these known patterns. Similarly, IDS matches packets against known attack signatures.

💻 **Technical Mapping:**
- Wanted poster = Signature (pattern definition)
- Features = Packet characteristics (flags, payload)
- Match = Detection event
- Limitation = Can't catch unknown criminals (zero-day)

---

## 🗳️ Peer Instruction Questions

### Question 1: SYN Flood Detection

> 💭 **PREDICTION:** How do you detect a SYN flood attack?

**Options:**
- A) Count HTTP requests
- B) Count SYN packets without corresponding ACKs ✓
- C) Check payload content
- D) Monitor bandwidth usage

**Correct answer:** B

**Explanation:** SYN flood sends many TCP SYN packets (connection requests) without completing the handshake (no ACK). Detection: track half-open connections per source IP; alert when threshold exceeded.

---

### Question 2: Threshold Tuning

> 💭 **PREDICTION:** What happens with a too-low detection threshold?

**Options:**
- A) Miss more attacks
- B) More false positives ✓
- C) Better detection
- D) Less CPU usage

**Correct answer:** B

**Explanation:** Low threshold = more sensitive = more false alarms. Normal traffic variations trigger alerts. High threshold = fewer false positives but might miss real attacks.

---

### Question 3: IPS Blocking

> 💭 **PREDICTION:** Why not block all detected attacks automatically?

**Options:**
- A) Too slow to respond
- B) False positives would block legitimate users ✓
- C) Can't modify traffic
- D) Violates privacy

**Correct answer:** B

**Explanation:** No detection is 100% accurate. Automatic blocking with false positives = blocking legitimate users. IPS mode requires careful tuning and monitoring.

---

### Question 4: Evasion Techniques

> 💭 **PREDICTION:** How might an attacker evade signature detection?

**Options:**
- A) Use encryption
- B) Fragment packets to split signature ✓
- C) Attack faster
- D) Attack slower

**Correct answer:** B

**Explanation:** If the signature "ATTACK" is in payload, splitting across fragments makes it invisible to simple signature matching. Advanced IDS reassembles fragments before checking.

---

## ❌ Common Misconceptions

### 🚫 "IDS prevents attacks"

**WRONG:** Having an IDS stops attacks.

**CORRECT:** IDS only DETECTS — it alerts humans who must take action. For automatic prevention, you need IPS, and even then it only blocks known patterns.

---

### 🚫 "More signatures = better security"

**WRONG:** Add every possible signature for maximum protection.

**CORRECT:** More signatures = more processing time = higher latency. Also increases false positive potential. Quality over quantity.

---

### 🚫 "Anomaly detection catches everything"

**WRONG:** Statistical anomaly detection catches all attacks.

**CORRECT:** Anomaly detection has high false positive rates and can be evaded with "low and slow" attacks that stay within normal thresholds.
