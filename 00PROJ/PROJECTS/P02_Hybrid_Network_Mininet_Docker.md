## 📚 Project Description

This project creates a hybrid network combining Mininet's virtual network emulation with Docker containers. The goal is to demonstrate how software-defined networks can interact with containerised applications, creating a flexible testing environment for network services.

You will build a topology where Mininet hosts communicate with Docker containers through bridge networks, enabling scenarios like testing microservices, load balancing, or distributed applications in an emulated network environment.

### 🎯 Learning Objectives

By completing this project, you will be able to:

- **Design** hybrid network topologies combining virtual and container networks
- **Configure** Docker networking to integrate with Mininet
- **Implement** bridge connections between different network domains
- **Test** network connectivity across hybrid environments
- **Analyse** traffic flow between Mininet hosts and Docker containers

### 🛠️ Technologies and Tools

| Technology | Purpose |
|------------|---------|
| **Mininet** | Virtual network emulation |
| **Docker** | Container runtime |
| **Docker Compose** | Multi-container orchestration |
| **OVS (Open vSwitch)** | Software switch for bridging |
| **Python** | Topology scripting |

## 🎯 Concept Analogies

### Hybrid Network = Airport with Multiple Terminals

🏠 **Real-World Analogy:**  
An airport has multiple terminals (Docker networks) connected by a central hub (bridge). Passengers (packets) can transfer between terminals, but each terminal has its own security and services. The airport control tower (controller) coordinates everything.

💻 **Technical Mapping:**
- Terminal A = Docker bridge network
- Terminal B = Mininet virtual network
- Central hub = OVS bridge connecting both
- Passengers = Network packets
- Security checkpoints = Network namespaces

⚠️ **Where the analogy breaks:**  
Unlike airports, network bridges can filter or modify packets, and "passengers" (packets) can be duplicated or dropped.

### Container Network = Apartment Building

🏠 **Real-World Analogy:**  
Each apartment (container) has its own address within the building (Docker network). The building has a main entrance (gateway) connecting to the street (host network). Neighbours can visit each other easily, but visitors from outside must go through the entrance.

## 🗳️ Peer Instruction Questions

### Question 1: Network Namespace Isolation

> 💭 **PREDICTION:** If you run `ip addr` inside a Docker container and on the Mininet host, will you see the same interfaces?

**Options:**
- A) Yes, they share the same network stack
- B) No, each has its own isolated network namespace ✓
- C) Only if they're on the same bridge
- D) Only root can see all interfaces

**Correct answer:** B

**Explanation:** Both Docker containers and Mininet hosts use Linux network namespaces for isolation. Each namespace has its own interfaces, routing table and firewall rules.

---

### Question 2: Bridge Connectivity

**Scenario:** A Mininet host (h1: 10.0.0.1) needs to reach a Docker container (web: 172.17.0.2).

**Question:** What is required for this communication?

**Options:**
- A) Nothing — Linux routes everything automatically
- B) A bridge connecting both networks with proper routing ✓
- C) Both must be on the same subnet
- D) Docker automatically creates routes to Mininet

**Correct answer:** B

**Explanation:** Different subnets require routing. You need a bridge (OVS or Linux bridge) connected to both networks, plus routing rules to forward traffic.

---

### Question 3: Docker Network Types

**Question:** Which Docker network driver allows containers to share the host's network namespace?

**Options:**
- A) bridge
- B) overlay
- C) host ✓
- D) none

**Correct answer:** C

**Explanation:** The `host` driver removes network isolation — the container uses the host's network directly. This can simplify Mininet integration but loses container isolation.

---

## ❌ Common Misconceptions

### 🚫 Misconception 1: "Docker containers can ping Mininet hosts by default"

**WRONG:** "Once both are running, they can communicate automatically."

**CORRECT:** Docker and Mininet use separate network namespaces and subnets. You must explicitly create a bridge and configure routing for cross-network communication.

---

### 🚫 Misconception 2: "docker0 bridge is the same as OVS bridge"

**WRONG:** "They're both bridges, so they work the same way."

**CORRECT:** docker0 is a Linux bridge for Docker containers. OVS is a more advanced software switch supporting OpenFlow. For SDN integration, you need OVS, not docker0.

---

### 🚫 Misconception 3: "Container IP addresses are permanent"

**WRONG:** "172.17.0.2 will always be my web container."

**CORRECT:** Docker assigns IPs dynamically. Use container names for DNS resolution within Docker networks, or assign static IPs in compose files.

## 📖 Project Glossary

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| **Network Namespace** | Isolated network stack (interfaces, routes, firewall) |
| **Bridge Network** | Layer 2 connection between network segments |
| **OVS (Open vSwitch)** | Multilayer virtual switch supporting OpenFlow |
| **Docker Bridge** | Default Docker network driver for container communication |
| **veth Pair** | Virtual ethernet pair connecting namespaces |
| **Gateway** | Device routing traffic between networks |

## 💭 Prediction Checkpoints

### E2 - Prototype Phase

> 💭 **Before connecting networks:** Can a Mininet host (10.0.0.0/24) ping a Docker container (172.17.0.0/16) without any bridge?
> 
> Expected: No — different subnets, no route

> 💭 **After adding bridge:** What route must be added on the Mininet host?
> 
> Expected: `ip route add 172.17.0.0/16 via [bridge_ip]`

## 🔨 Implementation Stages

### Stage 1 (Week 5) — Design

**Tasks:**
1. Design hybrid topology (Mininet + Docker components)
2. Plan IP addressing scheme for both networks
3. Document bridge configuration requirements

## ❓ Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: Docker containers can't reach Mininet hosts**

A: Check routing on both sides:
```bash
# On Mininet host
ip route add 172.17.0.0/16 via 10.0.0.254

# On Docker container
ip route add 10.0.0.0/24 via 172.17.0.1
```

**Q: OVS bridge won't connect to docker0**

A: Ensure docker0 exists and OVS has permission:
```bash
docker network inspect bridge
sudo ovs-vsctl add-port s1 docker0
```

**Q: How do I test cross-network connectivity?**

A: Use ping from both sides:
```bash
# From Mininet CLI
h1 ping 172.17.0.2

# From Docker container
docker exec web ping 10.0.0.1
```
