## 📚 Project Description

This project implements a network firewall using the Software-Defined Networking (SDN) paradigm. Instead of a traditional firewall based on dedicated hardware devices, you will implement a firewall application at the SDN controller level that filters traffic between nodes in a virtual network.

The Mininet emulation platform will be used to create a virtual network topology (computers and OpenFlow switches), controlled by an SDN controller (such as POX or Ryu) programmed in Python. The SDN firewall will inspect packets (based on IP addresses, TCP/UDP ports, or protocol type) and apply filtering rules (allow/block) dynamically by installing OpenFlow flows in the network switches.

### 🎯 Learning Objectives

By completing this project, you will be able to:

- **Explain** the SDN architecture and how it separates control and data planes
- **Implement** firewall rules using OpenFlow flow entries
- **Configure** virtual network topologies in Mininet
- **Analyse** network traffic to verify firewall behaviour
- **Evaluate** the impact of security rules on network performance

### 🛠️ Technologies and Tools

| Technology | Purpose | Documentation |
|------------|---------|---------------|
| **Mininet** | Virtual network emulation | [mininet.org](http://mininet.org) |
| **POX/Ryu** | SDN controller framework | [POX](https://github.com/noxrepo/pox), [Ryu](https://ryu-sdn.org) |

| **OpenFlow** | Switch-controller protocol | [OpenFlow Spec](https://opennetworking.org) |
| **Wireshark** | Packet capture and analysis | [wireshark.org](https://wireshark.org) |

### 📖 Key Concepts

| Concept | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Software-Defined Networking** | Separation of control plane from data plane |
| **OpenFlow Protocol** | Communication between controller and switches |
| **Flow Rules** | Match+Action entries in switch flow tables |
| **PacketIn/PacketOut** | Controller-switch message exchange |
| **Network Firewall** | Packet filtering based on rules |

## 🎯 Concept Analogies

### SDN Controller = Air Traffic Control Tower

🏠 **Real-World Analogy:**  
An air traffic control tower coordinates all aircraft. Planes don't decide their own routes — they follow instructions from the tower. The tower has the complete picture and makes all routing decisions.

🖼️ **Visual Representation:**
```
         [Controller/Tower]
          ↙    ↓     ↘
       [S1]   [S2]   [S3]    ← Switches follow orders
        ↓      ↓      ↓
      [H1]   [H2]   [H3]    ← Hosts (endpoints)
```

💻 **Technical Mapping:**
- Tower = SDN Controller (POX/Ryu)
- Planes = Packets flowing through network
- Instructions = Flow rules installed via OpenFlow
- Radar = PacketIn messages informing controller

⚠️ **Where the analogy breaks:**  
Unlike planes, packets can be duplicated, modified, or silently dropped. Also, flow rules persist in switches — the controller doesn't need to guide every single packet.

### Flow Table = Restaurant Order System

🏠 **Real-World Analogy:**  
A restaurant kitchen has standing orders: "All orders for Table 5 get extra sauce." New waiters check the order board before asking the manager. If there's no rule, they ask.

💻 **Technical Mapping:**
- Order board = Flow table in switch
- Standing order = Flow rule (match → action)
- Asking manager = PacketIn to controller
- Manager's response = FlowMod installing new rule

### Question 1: PacketIn Trigger

> 💭 **PREDICTION:** Before reading the options, think: when does a switch send a PacketIn message to the controller?

**Scenario:** An OpenFlow switch receives a packet destined for 10.0.0.5, but has no flow entry matching this destination.

**Options:**
- A) The switch drops the packet and logs an error
- B) The switch floods the packet to all ports (like a traditional switch)
- C) The switch sends a PacketIn message to the controller ✓
- D) The switch creates a default "allow all" flow entry

**Correct answer:** C

**Explanation:** In OpenFlow, when no flow rule matches an incoming packet, the switch encapsulates the packet in a PacketIn message and sends it to the controller. The controller then decides what to do and may install a new flow rule.

**Misconception targeted:** Students often confuse OpenFlow behaviour with traditional switch flooding.

---

### Question 2: Drop Action Behaviour

**Scenario:** The controller installs this flow rule:
```
match: ip_src=10.0.0.1, ip_dst=10.0.0.2
action: drop
```

**Question:** What happens to matching packets?

**Options:**
- A) Packets are returned to sender with ICMP "Destination Unreachable"
- B) Packets are silently discarded with no notification ✓
- C) Packets are forwarded to controller for logging
- D) Packets are queued until the flow rule expires

**Correct answer:** B

**Explanation:** The `drop` action silently discards packets. No ICMP message is generated unless explicitly programmed. This is different from a router that might send ICMP unreachable.

---

### Question 3: Flow Rule Persistence

**Scenario:** Host h1 pings h2. The controller installs a flow rule. Then h1 pings h2 again.

**Question:** What happens on the second ping?

**Options:**
- A) Another PacketIn is sent to the controller
- B) The switch processes the packet using the cached flow rule ✓
- C) The switch asks the controller if the rule is still valid
- D) The packet is dropped because the flow expired

**Correct answer:** B

**Explanation:** Once a flow rule is installed, subsequent matching packets are handled directly by the switch without controller involvement. This is the key performance benefit of SDN.

---

### Question 4: Multiple Switches

**Scenario:** A network has three switches: S1 → S2 → S3. A packet needs to travel from h1 (connected to S1) to h3 (connected to S3).

**Question:** How many FlowMod messages does the controller need to send for this path?

**Options:**
- A) 1 (only the first switch)
- B) 2 (entry and exit switches)
- C) 3 (one for each switch in the path) ✓
- D) 0 (switches figure it out themselves)

**Correct answer:** C

**Explanation:** Each switch needs its own flow rule to forward the packet to the correct output port. The controller must install rules in all switches along the path.

---

## ❌ Common Misconceptions

### 🚫 Misconception 1: "OpenFlow switches make routing decisions"

**WRONG:** "The switch decides whether to allow or block traffic based on its own logic."

**CORRECT:** In SDN, switches are "dumb" forwarding devices. They only execute flow rules installed by the controller. All intelligence is centralised in the controller.

**Verification:**
```bash
# Show flow table — only controller-installed rules
sudo ovs-ofctl dump-flows s1
# Output shows rules with "actions=" — no switch logic
```

---

### 🚫 Misconception 2: "PacketIn sends the whole packet to controller"

**WRONG:** "Every byte of large packets goes to the controller, causing performance issues."

**CORRECT:** By default, only the first N bytes (buffer) are sent. The switch keeps the full packet and can be instructed to forward it via PacketOut, or the controller can just install a rule for future packets.

**Why it matters:** This design prevents controller overload with large packets.

---

### 🚫 Misconception 3: "Flow rules last forever"

**WRONG:** "Once installed, a flow rule stays in the switch permanently."

**CORRECT:** Flow rules have timeouts (idle_timeout, hard_timeout). After the timeout, the rule is removed. This prevents stale rules from accumulating.

**Verification:**
```bash
# Check timeouts in flow rules
sudo ovs-ofctl dump-flows s1
# Look for "idle_timeout=" and "hard_timeout=" fields
```

---

### 🚫 Misconception 4: "Mininet containers are real VMs"

**WRONG:** "Each Mininet host runs in its own virtual machine."

**CORRECT:** Mininet uses Linux network namespaces, not VMs. Hosts share the same kernel but have isolated network stacks. This makes Mininet lightweight but means all hosts run the same OS.

---

### 🚫 Misconception 5: "The firewall blocks at the switch port"

**WRONG:** "Blocking a host means disconnecting its switch port."

**CORRECT:** SDN firewalls work at the flow level, not port level. You can block specific traffic (e.g., ICMP) while allowing other traffic (e.g., TCP) from the same host.

## 💭 Prediction Checkpoints

Include these prediction moments in your development process:

### E1 - Design Phase
> 💭 **Before designing topology:** How many switches do you need for your firewall rules? What happens if you use just one switch vs. multiple switches?

### E2 - Prototype Phase
> 💭 **Before running first test:** What will `pingall` show if your firewall blocks ICMP between h1 and h2?
> 
> Expected: h1 → h2 fails, h2 → h1 fails, other pairs succeed

> 💭 **Before checking flows:** How many flow rules will be in switch s1 after `pingall`?
> 
> Verify with: `sudo ovs-ofctl dump-flows s1 | wc -l`

### E3 - Final Phase
> 💭 **Before performance test:** What latency increase do you expect from the firewall?
> 
> Measure with: `h1 ping -c 100 h2` (compare with/without firewall)

## ❓ Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: Mininet won't start — error "cannot create interface"**

A: Clean previous sessions and run with sudo:
```bash
sudo mn -c                                    # Clean up
sudo mn --topo single,3 --controller remote   # Start fresh
```

**Q: Controller doesn't receive PacketIn messages**

A: Check switch-controller connection:
```bash
# In Mininet CLI
dpctl show
# Should show connection to controller IP
```

**Q: How do I verify the firewall is working?**

A: Test allowed and blocked traffic:
```bash
# In Mininet CLI
h1 ping -c 3 h2    # Should fail if blocked
h1 ping -c 3 h3    # Should succeed if allowed

# Check flow rules
sudo ovs-ofctl dump-flows s1
```

**Q: How do I see what the controller is doing?**

A: Check controller logs:
```bash
# POX logging
./pox.py log.level --DEBUG forwarding.l2_learning

# Or add print statements to your controller
```

**Q: Can I use Ryu instead of POX?**

A: Yes. Ryu has more features and better documentation:
```bash
pip install ryu
ryu-manager your_firewall.py
```

## 🔗 JavaScript → Python Bridge

You have experience with JavaScript from Web Technologies. Here's how concepts translate:

| JavaScript (TW) | Python (Networks) | Notes |
|-----------------|-------------------|-------|
| `const fn = (x) => x * 2` | `fn = lambda x: x * 2` | Arrow functions → lambda |
| `arr.map(x => x * 2)` | `[x * 2 for x in arr]` | List comprehension |
| `arr.filter(x => x > 0)` | `[x for x in arr if x > 0]` | Filter in comprehension |
| `JSON.parse(str)` | `json.loads(str)` | Parse JSON |
| `async/await` | `async/await` with `asyncio` | Similar syntax |

**Event handling comparison:**
```javascript
// JavaScript event listener
socket.on('data', (data) => {
    console.log(data);
});
```

```python
# Python POX event handler
def _handle_PacketIn(self, event):
    """Handle incoming packet event."""
    packet = event.parsed
    print(packet)
```
