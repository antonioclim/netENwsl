## 🎯 Concept Analogies

### Docker Bridge Network = Apartment Building

🏠 **Real-World Analogy:**  
An apartment building has internal hallways (bridge network). Residents (containers) can visit each other through these hallways without going outside. A doorman (gateway) handles visitors from outside. Each apartment has an intercom number (IP address) and a name plate (DNS name).

🖼️ **Visual Representation:**
```
        ┌─────────── Building (Bridge Network) ───────────┐
        │                                                  │
        │   ┌──────────┐    ┌──────────┐    ┌──────────┐  │

        │                       │                         │
        │              ┌────────▼────────┐               │
        │              │    Doorman      │               │
        │              │   (Gateway)     │               │
        │              │   172.18.0.1    │               │
        │              └────────┬────────┘               │
        └───────────────────────┼────────────────────────┘
                                │
                        Outside World (Host)
```

💻 **Technical Mapping:**
- Building = Docker bridge network
- Apartments = Containers
- Hallways = Internal network
- Doorman = Gateway/NAT
- Intercom numbers = IP addresses
- Name plates = Container DNS names

⚠️ **Where the analogy breaks:** In real buildings, everyone can hear you in the hallway. In Docker, traffic is isolated per network — containers on different networks can't communicate without explicit connection.

---

### Network Isolation = Gated Communities

🏠 **Real-World Analogy:**  
Different gated communities (networks) are isolated from each other. Residents can only visit other communities if they have access (container connected to multiple networks).

💻 **Technical Mapping:**
- Gated community = Docker network
- Resident = Container
- Access card to multiple communities = Container attached to multiple networks

## 🗳️ Peer Instruction Questions

### Question 1: Default Bridge vs Custom Bridge

> 💭 **PREDICTION:** What's the main advantage of custom bridge networks?

**Options:**
- A) Better performance
- B) Automatic DNS resolution between containers ✓
- C) More IP addresses
- D) Stronger security

**Correct answer:** B

**Explanation:** On the default bridge, containers can only communicate by IP. Custom bridge networks provide automatic DNS — containers can reach each other by name (e.g., `ping db` instead of `ping 172.17.0.3`).

**Misconception targeted:** Students think all bridge networks have DNS.

---

### Question 2: Host Network Mode

> 💭 **PREDICTION:** When would you use `--network host`?

**Options:**
- A) For better isolation
- B) When container needs host's exact network stack ✓
- C) For multi-container applications
- D) For security

**Correct answer:** B

**Explanation:** Host mode removes network isolation — container uses host's IP directly. Useful for performance-critical applications or when binding to specific host interfaces. But it sacrifices isolation.

---

### Question 3: Container IP Persistence

> 💭 **PREDICTION:** Does a container keep the same IP after restart?

**Options:**
- A) Yes, always
- B) No, IP can change ✓
- C) Only with Docker Compose
- D) Only on custom networks

**Correct answer:** B

**Explanation:** Container IPs are dynamically assigned. After restart, a container might get a different IP. This is why DNS-based discovery (by container name) is preferred over hardcoded IPs.

---

### Question 4: Overlay Network Purpose

> 💭 **PREDICTION:** When do you need an overlay network?

**Options:**
- A) For containers on the same host
- B) For containers on different hosts (Swarm/Kubernetes) ✓
- C) For internet access
- D) For better performance

**Correct answer:** B

**Explanation:** Overlay networks span multiple Docker hosts, enabling containers on different machines to communicate as if on the same network. Required for Docker Swarm and distributed deployments.

---

## ❌ Common Misconceptions

### 🚫 "Containers on the same host can always communicate"

**WRONG:** Just being on the same host doesn't enable communication.

**CORRECT:** Containers must be on the same Docker network OR have port mappings. Two containers on different bridge networks cannot reach each other directly.

**Evidence:** Create two containers on different networks and try to ping between them — it fails.

---

### 🚫 "Port mapping is required for container-to-container communication"

**WRONG:** You need `-p 8080:80` for containers to talk to each other.

**CORRECT:** Port mapping (`-p`) exposes ports to the HOST. Containers on the same network can communicate directly on any port without mapping.

---

### 🚫 "docker0 bridge is the best option"

**WRONG:** The default bridge (docker0) is sufficient for everything.

**CORRECT:** The default bridge lacks automatic DNS and has limited isolation options. User-defined bridge networks are recommended for any multi-container application.

## ❓ Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: Why can't my containers ping each other?**

A: Check they're on the same network:
```bash
docker network inspect mynetwork
```

**Q: How do I find a container's IP?**

A: Use inspect:
```bash
docker inspect -f '{{range.NetworkSettings.Networks}}{{.IPAddress}}{{end}}' container_name
```

**Q: DNS doesn't work between containers?**

A: Only custom networks have DNS. Default bridge doesn't. Create a user-defined network.
