## 📚 Project Description

This project implements a simplified Intrusion Detection System (IDS) that captures and analyses network traffic to identify suspicious patterns. Using Python libraries like Scapy or pyshark, you will develop an application capable of detecting common attack patterns such as port scans, ping floods and brute-force attempts.

The system will capture packets, analyse them against defined rules or thresholds and generate alerts when suspicious activity is detected.

### 🎯 Learning Objectives

By completing this project, you will be able to:

- **Capture** network packets using Python libraries
- **Parse** packet headers to extract relevant information
- **Implement** detection rules for common attack patterns
- **Design** alerting mechanisms for security events
- **Evaluate** false positive rates and detection accuracy

### 🛠️ Technologies and Tools

| Technology | Purpose |
|------------|---------|
| **Scapy** | Packet capture and manipulation |
| **pyshark** | Wireshark wrapper for Python |
| **PCAP files** | Stored traffic for analysis |
| **Docker** | Isolated test environment |
| **Wireshark** | Traffic verification |

## 🎯 Concept Analogies

### IDS = Security Camera System

🏠 **Real-World Analogy:**  
A building's security camera system records all activity (packet capture), analyses footage for suspicious behaviour (pattern matching), and alerts security guards (alerting) when something unusual is detected. It doesn't stop intruders (that's IPS) but identifies them.

💻 **Technical Mapping:**
- Cameras = Network interface in promiscuous mode
- Recording = PCAP file storage
- Motion detection = Threshold-based detection
- Facial recognition = Signature matching
- Alert system = Log files, notifications

⚠️ **Where the analogy breaks:**  
Unlike cameras that record everything, IDS may sample traffic or focus on specific protocols. Also, network attacks can happen in milliseconds.

### Signature vs Anomaly Detection = Known Faces vs Suspicious Behaviour

🏠 **Real-World Analogy:**  
Security can work two ways: checking faces against a "wanted" list (signature-based) or watching for unusual behaviour like someone trying many doors (anomaly-based).

💻 **Technical Mapping:**
- Wanted list = Signature database (known attack patterns)
- Unusual behaviour = Statistical anomaly (too many connections)

## 🗳️ Peer Instruction Questions

### Question 1: Promiscuous Mode

> 💭 **PREDICTION:** If your network interface is NOT in promiscuous mode, what traffic can the IDS capture?

**Options:**
- A) All traffic on the network segment
- B) Only traffic destined to or from the host ✓
- C) Only broadcast traffic
- D) No traffic at all

**Correct answer:** B

**Explanation:** Without promiscuous mode, the NIC only passes packets addressed to its MAC or broadcast/multicast. IDS needs promiscuous mode to see all traffic.

---

### Question 2: Port Scan Detection

**Scenario:** Host 10.0.0.5 sends SYN packets to ports 22, 23, 80, 443, 8080 on 10.0.0.10 within 2 seconds.

**Question:** What pattern indicates a port scan?

**Options:**
- A) Multiple SYN packets (normal for web browsing)
- B) Same source, same destination, many different destination ports ✓
- C) Packets without responses
- D) Large packet sizes

**Correct answer:** B

**Explanation:** Port scans are characterised by one source probing multiple ports on a target in a short time. The number of unique destination ports from a single source is the key metric.

---

### Question 3: False Positives

**Scenario:** Your IDS alerts on "more than 100 connections per minute from single IP."

**Question:** Which legitimate activity might trigger this alert?

**Options:**
- A) Normal web browsing
- B) A web server handling requests ✓
- C) Sending an email
- D) DNS lookup

**Correct answer:** B

**Explanation:** A busy web server legitimately receives many connections. This is why IDS tuning is critical — thresholds must match the environment.

## ❌ Common Misconceptions

### 🚫 Misconception 1: "IDS and IPS are the same"

**WRONG:** "My IDS will block the attack."

**CORRECT:** IDS only **detects** and alerts. IPS (Intrusion Prevention System) can **block** traffic. Your project is an IDS — it monitors but doesn't prevent.

---

### 🚫 Misconception 2: "Signature-based detection catches everything"

**WRONG:** "I have signatures for all attacks."

**CORRECT:** Signature-based detection only catches **known** attacks. New (zero-day) attacks need anomaly-based detection or updated signatures.

---

### 🚫 Misconception 3: "More alerts = better security"

**WRONG:** "My IDS generates 1000 alerts/hour, so it's working well."

**CORRECT:** Too many alerts cause "alert fatigue" — operators ignore them. A good IDS has high detection rate with low false positives.

---

### 🚫 Misconception 4: "Encrypted traffic can't be analysed"

**WRONG:** "HTTPS traffic is invisible to my IDS."

**CORRECT:** While payload is encrypted, metadata (IP addresses, ports, packet sizes, timing) is visible. Many attacks can be detected from metadata alone.

## 💭 Prediction Checkpoints

### E2 - Prototype Phase

> 💭 **Before running scan detection:** How many unique destination ports indicate a port scan? 5? 10? 100?
> 
> Consider: What's normal for a web browser?

> 💭 **Before testing with real traffic:** What percentage of alerts do you expect to be false positives?

## ❓ Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: Scapy requires root privileges**

A: Run with sudo or set capabilities:
```bash
sudo python3 ids.py
# Or
sudo setcap cap_net_raw+ep /usr/bin/python3
```

**Q: How do I test port scan detection?**

A: Use nmap from another host:
```bash
nmap -sS -p 1-1000 target_ip
```

**Q: How do I reduce false positives?**

A: Adjust thresholds based on your environment:
- Monitor normal traffic first
- Set thresholds above normal levels
- Consider whitelisting known services
