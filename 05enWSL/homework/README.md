# 📝 Homework — Week 5: IP Addressing and Subnetting

> Computer Networks — ASE, CSIE | by ing. dr. Antonio Clim

## Overview

This week's homework reinforces subnetting concepts and IPv6 transition planning through practical exercises.

## Assignments

| File | Topic | Difficulty | Est. Time |
|------|-------|------------|-----------|
| `hw_5_01_subnet_design.py` | VLSM Subnet Design for an Organisation | ⭐⭐ Intermediate | 60-90 min |
| `hw_5_02_ipv6_transition.py` | IPv6 Analysis and Transition Planning | ⭐⭐ Intermediate | 45-60 min |

## Assignment Details

### hw_5_01_subnet_design.py

Design a complete subnetting scheme using VLSM for a multi-department organisation.

**Learning Objectives:**
- Apply VLSM to allocate variable-sized subnets
- Calculate network addresses, broadcast addresses and usable host ranges
- Optimise address space utilisation
- Document IP allocation plans

**Key Skills:**
- Binary subnet calculations
- CIDR notation
- Address space planning

### hw_5_02_ipv6_transition.py

Analyse IPv6 addresses and understand dual-stack deployment concepts.

**Learning Objectives:**
- Parse and classify IPv6 address types
- Generate EUI-64 interface identifiers
- Compare IPv4 and IPv6 addressing
- Understand transition mechanisms

**Key Skills:**
- IPv6 address notation (expanded/compressed)
- Address type identification
- Transition planning

## Prerequisites

Before starting, ensure you have completed:
- Week 5 lab exercises (ex_5_01, ex_5_02)
- Reading: Theory summary and glossary

## Submission Guidelines

1. Complete all `TODO` sections in each file
2. Run the built-in verification tests
3. Ensure all prediction prompts are answered thoughtfully
4. Export any generated reports (JSON files)

## Grading Rubric

| Criterion | Points |
|-----------|--------|
| Correct implementation of core functions | 40% |
| All verification tests passing | 30% |
| Code quality (comments, type hints) | 15% |
| Prediction prompt engagement | 15% |

## Tips

- Start with the subnet design exercise as it reinforces fundamental concepts
- Use the `ipaddress` module for validation
- Draw out subnet allocations on paper first
- Remember: VLSM allocates largest requirements first
