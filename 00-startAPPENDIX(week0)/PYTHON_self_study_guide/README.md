## 🎯 What Is This?

This guide helps students who know **C, C++, JavaScript, Java or Kotlin** quickly understand Python code used in lab exercises. It is designed as a **translation guide**, not a Python course from scratch.

> "You do not need to learn Python from zero. You need to translate what you already know."

### 1. Check Your Environment
```bash
make check
```

Expected output:
```
Python version: Python 3.10.x or higher
Required modules:
  ✓ socket
  ✓ struct
  ✓ pyyaml
```

### 2. Take a Quick Assessment
```bash
make quiz-quick    # 10 questions, ~10 minutes
```

**Score interpretation:**
- **80%+** → Ready for labs, skim the guide
- **60-79%** → Review weak sections, then proceed
- **Below 60%** → Work through the full guide first

## ❓ FAQ

**Q: Is this mandatory?**  
A: No. You can complete labs without it, but it will save you time.

**Q: I know multiple languages. Which quiz should I take?**  
A: Take the quiz for your most recent language, or use `make quiz-quick` for a general assessment.

**Q: How do I know if I am ready for labs?**  
A: If you score 70%+ on the quiz and can answer the checkpoint questions, you are ready.

**Q: I got an error. What do I do?**  
A: Check [docs/TROUBLESHOOTING.md](docs/TROUBLESHOOTING.md) for 16 common scenarios with solutions.

**Q: The quiz says I need to review "bytes_and_strings". Where is that?**  
A: See [PYTHON_NETWORKING_GUIDE.md Step 2](PYTHON_NETWORKING_GUIDE.md#step-2-data-types-for-networking) and [examples/02_bytes_vs_str.py](examples/02_bytes_vs_str.py).
